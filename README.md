Topic: Recursion
Problem: Given two positive integers n and k, print all increasing sequences of length k such that the
elements in every sequence are from the first n natural numbers.
Examples:
1. Input: n = 2, k = 3
Output: 1 2
1 3
2 3
2. Input: n = 5, k = 5
Output: 1 2 3 4 5

Requirements:
1. Implement an iterative function which prints all increasing sequences.
2. Implement a recursive function which prints all increasing sequences.
• For each of implementations the goal is to analyze and explain time complexity, in terms of best-case,
average-case, and worst-case scenario where applicable.
• You should be able to provide a clear explanation of how each of the implemented algorithms works.

Additional information:
• Implementation can be done in any programming language.
